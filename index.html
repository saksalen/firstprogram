    <p>The Universe's average colour is called 'Cosmic latte'. In a 2002 study, astronomers found that the light coming from galaxies averaged into a beige colour thatâ€™s close to white.</p>
    <p>The tree which moves some to tears of joy is in<strong> the eyes of others only a green thing which stands in the way</strong>.<br> Some see nature all ridicule and deformity, and by these I shall not regulate my propositions</br>. And some see no nature at all.<br> But to the eyes of the man of imagination, nature is imagination itself</br>.</p>
